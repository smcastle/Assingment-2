 I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in unspecified business. I grew up in Coppell, TX (a suburb of Dallas) and have lived in Texas my entire life. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, reading, and spending too much time on Youtube!</p>

  I can usually be found at a coffeeshop, somewhere outside on campus, or, from time-to-time, running around in Disney World. My favorite foods include Pirate's Booty (it's good, trust me) and pasta, and I could probably survive on cold brew coffee. The way to my heart is a classic chocolate milkshake or a random trip to Target!  </p>
