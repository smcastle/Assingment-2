 I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in unspecified business. I grew up in Coppell, TX (a suburb of Dallas) and have lived in Texas my entire life. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, reading, and spending too much time on Youtube!</p>

  I am really looking forward to this summer and living on campus this coming fall! Outside of school, I can be found at the gym, doing something adventurous, or spending time with family and friends. I also love to travel and I definitely want to travel the world in the future.
